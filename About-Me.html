	<h1>Fun.</h1>
	<p>In my free time I like to participate in contributing my part towards social causes. I have been an active volunteer in Blossom NGO. I have taken part in various drives for raising money for students by putting up food stalls. I also like to volunteer to counsel children who have limited resources and wish to join MNCs.</br></br>Other than that I absolutely love cooking & baking. Trying new cuisines and then recreating them at home. Cooking has been my passion since childhood. It is my stress buster. </br></br>In my free time, I like to watch movies and TV shows on Netflix. I love reading books. </br> </br>I have also started gardening recently. Though I'm a novice, but I have made sure that I get cooking and medicinal herbs and chillies for my garden :) :)</p>
